# Assets Images

Place images here that will be imported and bundled by Vite.

## Usage

```tsx
import banner from "@/assets/images/banner.jpg";

<img src={banner} alt="Banner" />;
```

## Best for:

- Images used in components
- Optimized/processed images
- Images with TypeScript imports
- Small to medium images that benefit from bundling
